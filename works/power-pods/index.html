             <br>
             <br>
             When you use our services, you‚Äôre trusting us with your personal data. We understand this is a big responsibility, so we work hard to protect your personal data and put you in control. This Privacy Policy will help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can manage your information.
             <br>
             <br>
             If you are a resident of the European Union (‚ÄúEU‚Äù), the European Economic Area (‚ÄúEEA‚Äù), or Switzerland, processing of your personal data will always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
             <br>
             <br>
             GiddyUp is the Controller of this website, as defined in the GDPR. All personal data collected by GiddyUp is stored exclusively in secure hosting facilities in the US. GiddyUp has data processing agreements in place with our hosting facilities, ensuring compliance with GDPR. Please see our Terms of Service for details. All hosting is performed in accordance with the highest security regulations.
             <br>
             <br>
             In the case of a personal data breach, we shall notify the effected parties not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, where feasible and without undue delay, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. If the notification to the effected parties is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by the reasons for the delay when the notification is made.
             <br>

GiddyUp will promptly notify you in the event of any known unauthorized access to, or use of, your data.

             <h4 class="main-t">What Information do we collect, and how do we use that Information?</h4>

             <h4>Browser and Device Information.</h4>
             When you visit a GiddyUp website, we automatically collect some information about your device and your web browser based on a legitimate interest to this information, since it is needed to make our website function properly. We collect your browser‚Äôs language and country settings so we can display our website in your preferred language and your country‚Äôs currency. We collect information about your device in order to adapt our website to be displayed best on your type of device - smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop.

             <h4>Marketing Partner Attribution.</h4>
             GiddyUp works with a number of Marketing Partners who advertise GiddyUp products in a variety of places ‚Äì Facebook, Google, Pinterest, YouTube, MSN, etc. The mix keeps changing, since our Marketing Partners are always trying new ideas. We will update this policy notification as new partners are added.
             <br>
             <br>
             We have a legitimate interest in these Marketing Partners being properly credited for their efforts. So, we developed a system that passes a unique id for the Marketing Partner and a unique id for this sale across the Web pages you view along the way to making a product purchase. This system makes use of cookies (a small piece of text sent to your browser by a website you visit) and similar technologies. We also pass this identification information as additional parameters added to the end of the Web address of a page. If you leave a GiddyUp website and then come back, we try our best to re-establish this identification information. We also use a third-party processor for managing Marketing Partner attribution ‚Äì CAKE, which also uses cookies and IP addresses.
             <br>
             <br>
             Marketing Partner Attribution data is kept for 90 days.

             Another aspect of Marketing Partner attribution that we have a legitimate interest in are the systems provided by the advertisers for keeping track of successful and unsuccessful sales. The advertisers substantially raise the price of advertisements if they do not receive this information, which would make it economically infeasible for our Marketing Partners to operate.
             <br>
             <br>
             Advertiser Sales Attribution data is kept for 30 days.

             <h4>Advertising Audience Generation.</h4>
             Advertising platforms such as Facebook and Google have the concept of an audience, which is a group of people that come to a website over a period of time. GiddyUp and our Marketing Partners can utilize audiences in various ways ‚Äì to have the advertising platforms find people that are similar to the members of an audience, to show the members of an audience additional advertisements, to exclude members of an audience from additional advertisements, etc. GiddyUp has a legitimate interest in these systems, since advertising would not be financially feasible without utilizing audience mechanisms. But we understand if you do not wish to participate. You can opt-out of being part of an audience by unchecking the box below:

             <h4>Behavioral Tracking.</h4>

             GiddyUp makes use of third-party behavioral tracking systems such as HotJar, Google Analytics, Amplitude and Optimizely. These systems allow us to observe how people use our websites and enable us to improve how they operate. We also use these systems to perform A/B testing of new features and site improvements. This processing is a legitimate interest, but we understand that you might not wish to participate. You can opt-out of behavioral tracking by unchecking the box below:

             <div class="checkbox-item">

                 <label class="checkbox">

             <h4>Personal Information Collected When Purchasing Products.</h4>

             When you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase on our website, we collect the following personal information:
             <br>
             <br>
             <p class="text-list">
                 ‚Ä¢       IP Address <br><br>

                 ‚Ä¢       Email Address <br><br>

                 ‚Ä¢       Name <br><br>

                 ‚Ä¢       Shipping Address <br><br>

                 ‚Ä¢       Billing Address, if it is not the same as the Shipping Address <br><br>

                 ‚Ä¢       Phone Number <br><br>

                 ‚Ä¢       Credit Card, PayPal or Amazon Pay payment information. No credit card data is stored on our site. <br><br>
             </p>

             <br>
             <br>
             We refer to this information as ‚ÄúOrder Information‚Äù. We use the Order Information to fulfill your order (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with order acknowledgement and shipping confirmation emails). We will also send you reminder emails if you fill out some of the Order Information but don‚Äôt complete the purchase.
             <br>
             <br>
             We store your Order Information for at least year, since we are contractually obligated to be able to communicate with you about warranty coverage or other customer service issues. If a product has a warranty period longer than a year, your Order Information will be retained for that period.

             <h4>Communications from us after Product Purchase.</h4>
             GiddyUp will occasionally send you an email, text or instant message to let you know about new products or special offers available to you. You will always be able to opt-out of these communications if you wish. This is permitted based on the soft opt-in exemption for communicating with existing customers under the 2002 European ePrivacy Directive.

             <h4>Do Not Track. </h4>
             Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the websites you visit. However, there is no accepted standard for how a website should respond to this signal. We currently do not respond to do not track or similar signals.

             <h4>Your Rights under the GDPR</h4>
             Here is a list of the rights that all residents of the European Economic Area have under the GDPR. They don‚Äôt apply in all circumstances - if you wish to use any of them, we‚Äôll explain at that time if they are engaged or not.

             In no case shall GiddyUp, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, interns, suppliers, Service providers or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind, including, without limitation lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or any similar damages, whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, arising from your use of any of the Service or any products procured using the Service, or for any other claim related in any way to your use of the Service or any product, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the Service or any content (or product) posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the Service, even if advised of such a possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.



             <strong>SECTION 14 - INDEMNIFICATION</strong>

             You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless GiddyUp and our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, agents, contractors, licensors, service providers, subcontractors, suppliers, interns and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys√Ø¬ø¬Ω fees, made by any third-party due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms of Service or the documents they incorporate by reference, or your violation of any law or the rights of a third-party.



             <strong>SECTION 15 - SEVERABILITY</strong>

             In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.



             <strong>SECTION 16 - TERMINATION</strong>

             The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination of this agreement for all purposes.
             These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these Terms of Service at any time by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our Services, or when you cease using our site.
             If in our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term or provision of these Terms of Service, we also may terminate this agreement at any time without notice and you will remain liable for all amounts due up to and including the date of termination; and/or accordingly may deny you access to our Services (or any part thereof).



             <strong>SECTION 17 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT</strong>

             The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
             These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on this site or in respect to the Service constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).
             Any ambiguities in the interpretation of these Terms of Service shall not be construed against the drafting party.



             <strong>SECTION 18 - Governing Law Jurisdiction</strong>

             These Terms of Service and any separate agreements whereby we provide you Services shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California without regard to the choice of law principles thereof. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the State of California for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or therewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby, and hereby irrevocably waives any objection that such suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any manner permitted by law.

             <strong>SECTION 19 - Third-Party Services</strong>

             In addition to these Terms of Service, you also agree to be bound by the additional service-specific terms applicable to services you purchase from, or that are provided by, GiddyUp‚Äòs partners or other third parties.
             GiddyUp may from time to time recommend, provide you with access to, or enable third party software, applications (√Ø¬ø¬ΩApps√Ø¬ø¬Ω), products, services or website links (collectively, ‚ÄúThird Party Services‚Äù) for your consideration or use. Such Third-Party Services are made available only as a convenience, and your purchase, access or use of any such Third-Party Services is solely between you and the applicable third-party services provider (‚ÄúThird-Party Provider‚Äù). Any use by you of Third Party Services offered through the Services or GiddyUp√Ø¬ø¬Ωs website is entirely at your own risk and discretion, and it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions and/or privacy policies applicable to such Third-Party Services before using them. In some instances, GiddyUp may receive a revenue share from Third Party Providers that GiddyUp recommends to you.
             We do not provide any warranties with respect to Third Party Services. You acknowledge that GiddyUp has no control over Third Party Services and shall not be responsible or liable to anyone for such Third-Party Services. The availability of Third Party Services on GiddyUp√Ø¬ø¬Ωs websites, including the GiddyUp App Store, or the integration or enabling of such Third-Party Services with the Services does not constitute or imply an endorsement, authorization, sponsorship, or affiliation by or with GiddyUp. GiddyUp does not guarantee the availability of Third Party Services and you acknowledge that GiddyUp may disable access to any Third-Party Services at any time in its sole discretion and without notice to you. GiddyUp is not responsible or liable to anyone for discontinuation or suspension of access to, or disablement of, any Third-Party Service. GiddyUp strongly recommends that you seek specialist advice before using or relying on Third Party Services, to ensure they will meet your needs. In particular, tax calculators should be used for reference only and not as a substitute for independent tax advice when assessing the correct tax rates, you should charge to your customers.
             If you install or enable a Third-Party Service for use with the Services, you grant us permission to allow the applicable Third-Party Provider to access your data and to take any other actions as required for the interoperation of the Third-Party Service with the Services, and any exchange of data or other interaction between you and the Third-Party Provider is solely between you and such Third-Party Provider. GiddyUp is not responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of your data or other Materials, or for any corresponding losses or damages you may suffer, as a result of access by a Third-Party Service or a Third-Party Provider to your data or other Materials.
             Under no circumstances shall GiddyUp be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, extraordinary, exemplary or other damages whatsoever, that result from any Third-Party Services or your contractual relationship with any Third-Party Provider, including any Expert. These limitations shall apply even if GiddyUp has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing limitations shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
             You agree to indemnify and hold us and (as applicable) our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, GiddyUp partners, officers, directors, agents, employees, and suppliers harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys‚Äò fees, arising out of your use of a Third-Party Service or your relationship with a Third-Party Provider.

             <strong>Section 20. DMCA Notice and Takedown Procedure</strong>

             GiddyUp supports the protection of intellectual property and asks GiddyUp merchants to do the same. It is our policy to respond to all notices of alleged copyright infringement. If someone believes that one of our merchants is infringing their intellectual property rights, they can send a DMCA Notice to the GiddyUp designated agent using our form. Upon receiving a DMCA Notice, we may remove or disable access to the Materials claimed to be a copyright infringement. Once provided with a notice of takedown, the merchant can reply with a counter notification using our form if they object to the complaint. The original complainant has 14 business days after we receive a counter notification to seek a court order restraining the merchant from engaging in the infringing activity, otherwise we restore the material. For more information, see our DMCA Notice and Takedown Procedure.
             GiddyUp respects intellectual property rights and you should too. If we receive a DMCA Notice, we may disable access or remove the allegedly infringing content from your website. If you don‚Äòt think the claim is valid, you can proceed with a counter notification.
             If you believe one of our merchants is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send GiddyUp a DMCA Notice. We will expeditiously disable access or remove the content and notify the merchant. Be advised that we post all notices we receive.

             <strong>SECTION 21 - PRIVACY and DATA PROTECTION</strong>

             GiddyUp is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information and the personal information of your customers. By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that GiddyUp&sdquo;s collection, usage and disclosure of this personal information is governed by our Privacy Policy.

             <strong>SECTION 22 - CHANGES TO TERMS OF SERVICE</strong>

             We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to update, change or replace any part of these Terms of Service by posting updates and changes to our website. It is your responsibility to check our website periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access to our website or the Service following the posting of any changes to these Terms of Service constitutes acceptance of those changes.
