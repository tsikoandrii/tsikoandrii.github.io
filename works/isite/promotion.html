            <p class="default-text">Let's look at the site promotion using the Yandex system as an example.Yandex.Direct:
                The first 3 results that we see in the list of search engine results are contextual advertising. We are engaged in the promotion of sites in the Yandex system.Yandex. Direct and Google adwords. And we are a certified Yandex agency.</p>

                <div class="first-row"><img src="img/promotion/times.svg"><span>Disadvantages</span></div>
                <p class="text">1. No company (including market leaders) engaged in SEO-promotion of sites, DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE RESULT. The reason is the regular change of search algorithms most search engine (Google) and ignorance of the precise mechanisms that would definitely get into the top ranks (all used for promotion approaches, "grope" by trial and error). Thus, without getting any result (without seeing yourself in the top ten) you will not be able to receive any compensation (please read the contract carefully!) the money spent and, most importantly, the time lost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
2. Even after getting the result, you have no guarantees that after the next change of algorithms you will not fall hundreds/thousands of points down.
                    <br>
                    <br>
3. The need for CONSTANT PAYMENT for promotion. The inability to stop it if necessary. As soon as you stop paying for regular services to promote your site, you immediately begin to gradually move lower and lower in the search results. And by the time you decide to advertise the site again (for example, the season will come), you will have to start all over again.

            <div class="block-card">
                <div class="first-row"><img src="img/promotion/compare.svg"><span>The most common misconceptions</span></div>
                <p class="text"><span>«My competitors will click on me and take my money!»</span>
                    <br>
Answer: NO! Any search engine is interested in the effectiveness of its contextual advertising and STRICTLY monitors the impossibility of re-debiting money when you click on the ad again. This is achieved by tracking the ip addresses of the object, its behavior on the site (i.e., if it's just a click and no action on the site happens, then the funds will not be debited from you) and other mechanisms…
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span>«No one clicks on the ad, everyone immediately looks below!»</span>
                    <br>
Answer: NO! The greatest traffic passes through contextual advertising. This is quite natural, since these sites are located higher in the search results and on sites that give specialized advertising, there is always a ready-made, formed commercial offer. The most striking example, how did you find us?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span>«Very expensive, and unprofitable!»</span>
                    <br>
Answer: Sometimes it is expensive, sometimes it is extremely cheap. It depends on the queries you choose for yourself! It is important to choose the right queries. To have commercial requests, and not a General requests. For example, the query " TV " is completely wrong, because people can search for general information about what a TV is, they can search for instructions on how to work with a TV, they just want to read reviews. The correct query is "buy a TV". A big plus of contextual advertising is the ability to select requests for your budget! In contrast to SEO-promotion.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span>«We've already tried it, just leaked the money, there are no customers!»</span>
                    <br>
Answer: Read the paragraph above. You may have selected non-target queries. Then your experience cannot be regarded as objective. It is also possible that you have written the wrong ad titles and texts. You need a lot of experience to create really targeted headlines and texts. Contact our managers for advice!

                    <div class="card-title">Flexibility</div>
                    <p class="card-text">Flexibility lies in the ability to start and stop an advertising campaign at any time (including immediately after creating and filling out the site)! For example, you are engaged in the construction of summer cottages (selling bathing suits, organizing summer camps, or vice versa, selling anti-reagents, sleds or fur coats) and your main work is carried out in a certain season. Thus, it is profitable for you to advertise during the season, and not to spend the advertising budget during the rest of the year. Contextual advertising will allow you to start and stop the campaign at the right time! Without waiting for long months of promotion and without paying for promotion in those months when it does not make a profit. We make you a website and you immediately appear in the first places of search results!</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Independence contextual advertising – is the assurance that you are always in the Top of search results, no matter how often and how deep the search engine (Google) changes its search algorithms. Naturally, the change of algorithms leads to a change in the ranking of sites that do not use the context, i.e. they try to move forward with the help of SEO (search engine optimization).</p>
